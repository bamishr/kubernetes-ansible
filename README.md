cp group_vars/all.yml.example group_vars/all.yml
ansible-playbook -i inventory cluster.yml
```

- yum-repo - installs epel repo
- sslcert - create all ssl certificates require to run secure K8S cluster
- runtime-env - common settings for container runtime environment
- docker - install latest docker release on all cluster nodes
- containerd - IF you want to use containerd runtime instead of Docker, use this role and enable this in group variable file
- etcd - setup etcd cluster, running as container on all master nodes
- haproxy - setup haproxy for API service HA, running on all master nodes
- keepalived - using keepalive for HA of IP address for kube-api server, running on all master nodes
- master - setup kubernetes master controller components - `kube-apiserver`, `kube-controller`, `kube-scheduler`, `kubectl` client
- node - setup kubernetes node agent - `kubelet`
- addon - to create addon services: `flanneld`, `kube-proxy`, `kube-dns`, `metrics-server`
